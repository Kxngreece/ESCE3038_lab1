  Question 1
Write a function, parallel(), that, when called, outputs the effective resistance of a network of 2 or more resistors connected in parallel. The function should be able to accept a list of numbers of any length.
Parameters:
    *resistor_values (float): Variable number of resistance values.

Question 2
Write a function, potential_divider(), that takes two values as argument, a number that represents a voltage supply value and a list of numbers that represent resistance values of resistors connected in series. The function should output the voltage drop across each resistor in your resistor list. The function should be able to accept a list of numbers of any length.

   Calculate the voltage drop across each resistor in a potential divider circuit.
    Parameters:
    - voltage_supply (float): The voltage supply value.
    - resistor_values (list): A list of resistance values of resistors connected in series.
    Returns:
    - list: A list containing the voltage drop across each resistor.
  
Question 3
Write a function, temperature_check(), that accepts a single number, a patient's body temperature, and a single character, the unit of temperature. The function should output whether the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has normal body temperature based on the number passed to the function.

The second value passed as argument should tell the function whether the condition should calculated in degrees celcius or degrees fahrenheit.

An appropriate message should be written to the screen with the result. You’re free to use what ever reasonable temperature limits you feel will adequately act as boundaries for these conditions.
    Parameters:
    - temperature (float): The patient's body temperature.
    - unit (str): The unit of temperature, either "C" for Celsius or "F" for Fahrenheit.

   Returns:
    - str: A message indicating the patient's temperature condition.
